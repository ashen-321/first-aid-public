    "# Multi-Agentic Orchestration and Reasoning with MCP, A2A and Langgraph Using Amazon Bedrock with OpenAI Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of multi-agentic orchestration and reasoning has become pivotal for tackling complex, multimodal tasks. This notebook delves into the innovative approach of leveraging Amazon Bedrock with an OpenAI proxy to facilitate sophisticated agent interactions. By employing Langgraph for the orchestration of agents, we can utilize the Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol (MCP) to standardize agent-to-tool interfaces, ensuring seamless communication and operation. Additionally, the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework enables intra-agent collaboration, fostering collective reasoning capabilities. Together, these technologies empower agents to synergize their strengths, resulting in enhanced problem-solving efficiency and adaptability across diverse, multimodal scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: This step is to use any string (without spaces) you like to create a custom API Key (credential) that will be used to access the proxy API later. This key does not have to match your actual OpenAI key, and you don't need to have an OpenAI API key. please keep the key safe and private.\n",
